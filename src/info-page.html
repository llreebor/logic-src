                            people dream about at night? I’m talking about the kind of brand that they share with
                            friends. The kind of brand where people buy whatever you sell, and can’t wait for your next
                            product launch… For that, you need a higher level of design fueled by real data about what
                            people really want. On-Purpose design is LogicPlum’s solution to help you get that data and
                            build that brand.
